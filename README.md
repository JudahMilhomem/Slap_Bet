# Slapsgiving 4: Return of The Slap
A Countdown Timer for a very special ocasion... 
This is a simple program for a countdown, using only basic HTML, CSS and JS. It's a very simple little project developed by myself, that I did only to test some of my knowledge on the subject of Web Development to this point.
Inspiration was, of course, taken from the great "Slap Bet Saga", from "How I Met Your Mother". The idea was to replicate the Slap Countdown site that Marshall uses for his third slap. Doing this was kinda fun, and I think is a good place to start somehow scratching the surface of this topic.
